        <h1>Poseidon</h1>
        <h2>Greek God of the Sea</h2>
        <p>"The Sea does not like to be restrained"</p>
        <p>Poseidon was one of the Twelve Olympians in the Greek religion and myth, god of the sea, storms, earthquakes and horse. He also had the cult title "earth shaker". however, it seems that he was originally a god of the waters. He is often regarded as the tamer or father of horses, and with a strike of his trident, he created springs which are related to the word horse. His Roman equivalent is Neptune.</p>
        <p>Poseidon became lord of the sea following the defeat of his father Cronus, the world was divided by lot among his three sons; Zeus was given the sky, Hades the underworld, and Poseidon the sea, with the Earth and Mount Olympus belonging to all three.</p>
        <p>Poseidon was revered. As he was the gatekeeper to a world much bigger than our land; the seas.</p>
